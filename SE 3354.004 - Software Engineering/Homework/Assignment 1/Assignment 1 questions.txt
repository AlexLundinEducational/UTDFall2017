How does the waterfall model differ from the iterative model? What are the main advantages of
the latter over the former?

	Waterfall
		testing or validation after each step
		no iterations
		
		Cons
			Takes to long
			Small errors are costly
	Iterative
		Infinite weak cycles
		

		Advantages
			Less effort on each iteration
			plan for change
			Software is always useable, even with minor flaws
			
II
Use form-based specification to describe how the students can add, remove, and change
their course registrations

Network-based course registration system

	Requirement 	No conflicting time slots, all course pre-requisets met, good academic standing, authorization to register
	Pre-condition 	Course selected
	Postcondition	Update to main database, update to clients schedule
	Side effects	Time slot filled on clients schedule, one less slot avaiable in the class offerings
	
	Function		Remove
	Description		Remove course to registration schedule
	Inputs 			Course identifier

	I used a abstract class to define the common methods each element would use
	In addition to the interface which would contains the accept method signature
