November 13th is the intermediate checkpoint of project progress on implementation, documentation, and testing. 
You do not need to turn in anything by the deadline, but you are expected to have significant amount of artifacts for assessment on your project repo. 

We will organize to demonstrate the prototype implementation during the week of Nov. 13.
This assignment will not be graded.
