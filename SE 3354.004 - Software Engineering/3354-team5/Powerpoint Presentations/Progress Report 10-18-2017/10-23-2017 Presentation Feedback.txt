	Dr. Shiyi Feedback to our Group Specifically
	
	Good job presenting your project!

	Comments on requirements:

	1. "Secure" login can be a complicated feature to implement. 
	It is recommended to realize other basic features before digging into the security aspects of the system (basic login/registration feature is welcomed).

	Comments on class diagram:

	1. I am not sure about a few "generalization" relations in the diagram. For example, what does it mean "Login" is a "User" and "User" is a "MakeCalendar"?

	2. When an event is added/edited/shared, the "events" field of User will be changed, right?

	3. I suggest you implement the basic add/edit events before "share".
